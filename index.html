                        Sophia is a social humanoid robot developed by Hong Kong-based company Hanson Robotics.
                        Sophia was activated on April 19, 2015[1] and made her first public appearance at South by Southwest Festival (SXSW)
                        in mid-March 2016 in Austin, Texas, United States.[2] She is able to display more than 50 facial expressions.

                        Sophia has been covered by media around the globe and has participated in many high-profile interviews.
                        While interviewers around the world have been impressed by the sophistication of many of Sophia's responses to their questions,
                        the bulk of Sophia's meaningful statements are believed by experts to be somewhat scripted.[3]

                        In October 2017, Sophia, the robot became the first robot to receive citizenship of any country.
                        In November 2017, Sophia was named the United Nations Development Programme's first ever Innovation Champion,
                        and the first non-human to be given any United Nations title.
